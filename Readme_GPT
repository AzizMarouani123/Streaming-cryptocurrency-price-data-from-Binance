# README_GPT

This document lists all the questions and clarifications I asked from AI (ChatGPT) during the development of my project.

## Visualization Issues
1. **Why are the images in my README file not displaying, even though the path is correct?**
   - Example paths: 
     - `![Price Distribution](Plots/price distribution.png)`
     - `![Top 10 Symbols](Plots/top 10 symbol.png)`
     - `![Price Trend](Plots/price trend for symbol.png)`
     - `![Price Distribution Boxplot](Plots/price distribution by symbol.png)`

2. **What is the correct format and directory structure to ensure the images display properly in Markdown?**
3. **How do I fix spaces in image filenames to avoid rendering issues?**

## Technical Implementation
4. **What libraries and dependencies do I need to include for a Kafka producer and consumer setup using Python?**
8. **How do I structure the flow of streaming data from the Binance API using Kafka and PyFlink?**
9. **What are the steps to install and set up Apache Kafka locally?**

10. **How can I process and save streaming data in PyFlink with a sliding window operation?**
11. **How do I visualize the processed data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn?**
12. **What are the key plots I can create for price distribution, trends, and symbol analysis?**

## Troubleshooting and Debugging
13. **Why is Kafka not connecting to my Python producer/consumer?**
14. **How can I resolve version incompatibilities between PyFlink, Kafka, and Python?**
15. **How do I handle JSON serialization and deserialization issues while streaming data?**

## Final Project Requirements
16. **What sections should I include in my README file to make it clear and professional?**
17. **How do I present the visualizations generated by the project in the README?**
18. **How do I structure and name the additional "README_GPT" file to meet the project requirements?**

---

## Clarification Request
19. **Can you provide a summary of all questions I have asked to include in this "README_GPT" file?**
